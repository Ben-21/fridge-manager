## CI / CD
The project runs on my own cloud server and is developed using continous integration and contionous deployment. For this I set up a  NGINX-Webserver and a Docker Environment. My App, the NGINX-Webserver and Certbot (for SSL Certificates) run as a container. All is configured and started using one Docker-Compose file. 
CI and CD is triggered by merging a branch into the Main-Branch.

## Overview

The deployed project can be found at [Fridge Manager](https://fridge-manager.schaefer-inet.de)  
The app is **only for mobile view** designed - please use your phone or switch your browser, via inspect/ dev-tools, to mobile view.
